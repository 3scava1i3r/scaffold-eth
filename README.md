# Welcome to Scaffold-eth

## About Scaffold-eth

Scaffold-eth provides an off-the-shelf stack for rapid prototyping on Ethereum, giving developers access to state-of-the-art tools to quickly learn and ship an Ethereum-based dApp.

## The Scaffold-eth stack

Scaffold-eth is not a product itself but more of a combination or stack of other great products. It allows you to quickly build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends. It leverages:

* **Hardhat** for running local networks, deploying and testing smart contracts.
* **React** for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made components and hooks.
* **Ant** for your UI. But can be easily changed to Bootstrap or some other library you prefer.
* **Surge** for publishing your app.
* Tenderly / The Graph / Etherscan / Infura / Blocknative and more!
* Support for L2 / Sidechains like Optimism and Arbitrum.

## About this Guide

This guide is meant to be an introduction to Scaffold-eth. 

In the **Getting Started** section we start by going over how to install and run the sample project included with Scaffold-eth, as well as key pieces you can tweak to start learning how it works and how it interacts with Hardhat and React.

Once you have the sample project running, in the **Solidity** section we present you with some tips and learning material to get you on the path of confidently developing smart contracts and deploying them to your network of choice.

The **React App** section contains a lot of useful information on how the sample app is set up, as well as details on the different hooks, helpers and components shipped with Scaffold-eth.

Once you have built something you want to show to the world, check the **Deployment** section to learn how to publish your app on the internet.

The **Infrastructure** section contains information on how to work with the supported protocols/products/libraries.

The **Infrastructure** section contains information on how to work with the supported ~~protocols~~/products/libraries.
